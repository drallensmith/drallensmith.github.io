.. py:module:: activations
   :synopsis: Has the built-in activation functions and code for using them and adding new user-defined ones.

activations
---------------
Has the built-in :term:`activation functions <activation function>`, code for using them, and code for adding new user-defined ones.

  .. py:exception:: InvalidActivationFunction(TypeError)

    Exception called if an activation function being added is invalid according to the `validate_activation` function.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.91-github
      Base of exception changed to more-precise TypeError.

  .. py:function:: validate_activation(function)

    Checks to make sure its parameter is a function that takes a single argument.

    :param object function: Object to be checked.
    :raises InvalidActivationFunction: If the object does not pass the tests.

  .. py:class:: ActivationFunctionSet

    Contains the list of current valid activation functions, including methods for adding and getting them.

    .. py:method:: add(name, function)

      After validating the function (via `validate_activation`), adds it to the available activation functions under the given name. Used
      by :py:meth:`DefaultGenomeConfig.add_activation <genome.DefaultGenomeConfig.add_activation>`.

      :param str name: The name by which the function is to be known in the :ref:`configuration file <activation-function-config-label>`.
      :param function: The function to be added.
      :type function: `function`

    .. py:method:: get(name)

      Returns the named function, or raises an exception if it is not a known activation function.

      :param str name: The name of the function.
      :raises InvalidActivationFunction: If the function is not known.

    .. py:method:: is_valid(name)

      Checks whether the named function is a known activation function.

      :param str name: The name of the function.
      :return: Whether or not the function is known.
      :rtype: bool

.. note::
  TODO: Suggested simplification for the below: Make ``__config_items__`` a dict of lists, with name -> [value_type, default] -
  no default if the last is None. This would also allow moving get_config_params into the BaseAttribute class, although config_item_names may require
  some modifications. (A default capability will be needed for future expansions of the attributes, such as different types of initializations, and for
  enabling better handling of the current activation/aggregation function defaults.)

  The above is mostly/entirely done in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch.

.. py:module:: attributes
   :synopsis: Deals with attributes used by genes.

attributes
-------------
Deals with :term:`attributes` used by :term:`genes <gene>`.

  .. inheritance-diagram:: attributes

  .. py:class:: BaseAttribute(name)

    Superclass for the type-specialized attribute subclasses, used by genes (such as via the :py:class:`genes.BaseGene` implementation). Calls
    `config_item_names` to set up a listing of the names of configuration items using `setattr`.

    .. py:method:: config_item_names()

      Formats a list of configuration item names by combining the attribute's name with the attribute class' list of ``__config_items__``.

      :return: A list of configuration item names.
      :rtype: list(str)

  .. py:class:: FloatAttribute(BaseAttribute)

    Class for numeric :term:`attributes` such as the :term:`response` of a :term:`node`; includes code for configuration, creation, and mutation.

    .. py:method:: get_config_params()

      Uses `config_item_names` to get its list of configuration item names, then gets a `float`-type :py:class:`config.ConfigParameter` instance for each
      and returns it.

      :return: A list of ``ConfigParameter`` instances.
      :rtype: list(object)

    .. py:method:: clamp(value, config)

      Gets the minimum and maximum values desired from ``config``, then ensures that the value is between them.

      :param float value: The value to be clamped.
      :param object config: The configuration object from which the minimum and maximum desired values are to be retrieved.
      :return: The value, if it is within the desired range, or the appropriate end of the range, if it is not.
      :rtype: float

    .. py:method:: init_value(config)

      Initializes the attribute's value, (currently always) using a gaussian distribution with the configured mean and standard deviation followed by `clamp` to
      keep the result within the desired range.

      :param object config: The configuration object from which the mean and standard deviation values are to be retrieved.
      :return: The new value.
      :rtype: float

    .. index:: ! mutation

    .. py:method:: mutate_value(value, config)

      May replace (as if reinitializing, using `init_value`), mutate (using a 0-mean gaussian distribution with a configured standard
      deviation from ``mutate_power``), or leave alone the input value, depending on the configuration settings (of ``replace_rate`` and ``mutate_rate``).
      TODO: Note that the ``replace_rate`` is likely to be lower, so should be checked second. (Done in the
      `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch.)

      :param float value: The current value of the attribute.
      :param object config: The configuration object from which the parameters are to be extracted.
      :return: Either the original value, if unchanged, or the new value.
      :rtype: float

  .. py:class:: BoolAttribute(BaseAttribute)

    Class for boolean :term:`attributes` such as whether a :term:`connection` is :term:`enabled` or not; includes code for configuration, creation, and mutation.

    .. py:method:: get_config_params()

      Uses `config_item_names` to get its list of configuration item names, then gets a `bool`-type or `float`-type :py:class:`config.ConfigParameter`
      instance for each and returns it.

      :return: A list of ``ConfigParameter`` instances.
      :rtype: list(object)

    .. py:method:: init_value(config)

      Initializes the attribute's value, either using a configured default or (if the default is ``None``) with a 50/50 chance of ``True`` or ``False``.

      :param object config: The configuration object from which the default parameter is to be retrieved.
      :return: The new value.
      :rtype: bool

    .. index:: ! mutation

    .. py:method:: mutate_value(value, config)

      With a frequency determined by the ``mutate_rate`` (which is more precisely a ``replace_rate``) configuration parameter, replaces
      the value with a 50/50 chance of ``True`` or ``False``; note that this has a 50% chance of leaving the value unchanged. TODO: Have different
      chances possible of :term:`mutation` in each direction. Also, do not check vs `random` if the ``mutate_rate`` is 0 (done in the
      `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch).

      :param bool value: The current value of the attribute.
      :param object config: The configuration object from which the ``mutate_rate`` parameter is to be extracted.
      :return: Either the original value, if unchanged, or the new value.
      :rtype: bool

  .. py:class:: StringAttribute(BaseAttribute)

    Class for string attributes such as the :term:`aggregation function` of a :term:`node`, which are selected from a list of options;
    includes code for configuration, creation, and mutation.

    .. py:method:: get_config_params()

      Uses `config_item_names` to get its list of configuration item names, then gets a `str`-type, `list`-type or `float`-type :py:class:`config.ConfigParameter`
      instance for each and returns it.

      :return: A list of ``ConfigParameter`` instances.
      :rtype: list(object)

    .. py:method:: init_value(config)

      Initializes the attribute's value, either using a configured default or (if the default is either ``None`` or ``random``) with a randomly-chosen member
      of the ``options`` (each having an equal chance). Note: It is possible for the default value, if specifically configured, to **not** be one of the options.

      :param object config: The configuration object from which the default and, if necessary, ``options`` parameters are to be retrieved.
      :return: The new value.
      :rtype: str

    .. index:: ! mutation

    .. py:method:: mutate_value(value, config)

      With a frequency determined by the ``mutate_rate`` (which is more precisely a ``replace_rate``) configuration parameter, replaces
      the value with an one of the ``options``, with each having an equal chance; note that this can be the same value as before. (It is possible to crudely
      alter the chances of what is chosen by listing a given option more than once, although this is inefficient given the use of the `random.choice` function.)
      TODO: Do not check vs `random` if the ``mutate_rate`` is 0 (done in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_
      branch). (Longer-term, add configurable probabilities of which option is used; eventually, as with the
      improved version of RBF-NEAT, separate genes for the likelihoods of each (but always doing some change, to prevent overly-conservative evolution
      due to its inherent short-sightedness), allowing the genomes to control the distribution of options, will be desirable.)

.. py:module:: checkpoint
   :synopsis: Uses `pickle` to save and restore populations (and other aspects of the simulation state).

checkpoint
---------------
Uses :py:mod:`pickle` to save and restore populations (and other aspects of the simulation state).

  .. py:class:: Checkpointer(generation_interval=100, time_interval_seconds=300)

    A reporter class that performs checkpointing, saving and restoring the simulation state (including population, randomization, and other aspects).
    It saves the current state every ``generation_interval`` generations or ``time_interval_seconds`` seconds, whichever happens first.

    :param generation_interval: If not None, maximum number of generations between checkpoints.
    :type generation_interval: int or None

      `ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser class <https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/configparser.html#ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser>`_) to gather the
      configuration parameter from the appropriate configuration file :ref:`section <configuration-file-sections-label>`. Parsing varies depending on the type.

      :return: The configuration parameter value
      :rtype: str or int or bool or float or list

    A simple container for user-configurable parameters of NEAT. The four parameters ending in ``_type`` may be the built-in ones or user-provided objects,
    which must make available the methods ``parse_config`` and ``write_config``, plus others depending on which object it is. (For more information on the
    objects, see below and :ref:`customization-label`.) ``Config`` itself takes care of the ``NEAT`` parameters. For a description of the configuration file,

    :raises AssertionError: If any of the objects lack a ``parse_config`` method.

    .. py:method:: save(filename)

      Opens the specified file for writing (not appending) and outputs a configuration file from the current configuration. Uses :py:func:`write_pretty_params` for
      the ``NEAT`` parameters and the appropriate class ``write_config`` methods for the other sections.

  .. index:: key

  .. py:class:: DefaultGenome(key)

    A :term:`genome` for generalized neural networks. For class requirements, see :ref:`genome-interface-label`.
    Terminology:
    :term:`pin` - Point at which the network is conceptually connected to the external world; pins are either input or output.
    :term:`node` - Analog of a physical neuron.
    :term:`connection` - Connection between a pin/node output and a node's input, or between a node's output and a pin/node input.
    :term:`key` - Identifier for an object, unique within the set of similar objects.
    Design assumptions and conventions.
    1. Each output pin is connected only to the output of its own unique neuron by an implicit connection with weight one. This connection is permanently enabled.
    2. The output pin's key is always the same as the key for its associated neuron.
    3. Output neurons can be modified but not deleted.

      Required interface method. Configures a new genome (itself) based on the given

      starting :term:`nodes <node>` (as defined by :term:`num_hidden <hidden node>`, :term:`num_inputs <input node>`, and

      :param object config: Genome configuration object.

    .. index:: ! crossover

      Required interface method. Configures a new genome (itself) by :term:`crossover` from two parent genomes. :term:`disjoint`
      or :term:`excess` genes are inherited from the fitter of the two parents, while :term:`homologous` genes use the gene class' crossover function
      (e.g., :py:meth:`genes.BaseGene.crossover`).

      :param object genome2: The second parent genome.
      :param object config: Genome configuration object.

    .. index:: ! mutation

    .. py:method:: mutate(config)

      Required interface method. :term:`Mutates <mutation>` this genome. What mutations take place are determined by configuration file settings, such

      :ref:`conn_add_prob <conn-add-prob-label>` and ``conn_delete_prob`` for the likelihood of adding or removing a :term:`connection`. (Currently,
      more than one of these can happen with a call to ``mutate``; a TODO is to add a configuration item to choose whether or not multiple mutations
      can happen simultaneously.) Non-structural mutations (to gene :term:`attributes`) are performed by calling the appropriate ``mutate`` method(s) for
      connection and node genes (generally :py:meth:`genes.BaseGene.mutate`).

      :param object config: Genome configuration object.

    .. index:: node

    .. py:method:: mutate_add_node(config)

      Takes a randomly-selected existing connection, turns its :term:`enabled` attribute to ``False``, and makes two new (enabled) connections with a
      new :term:`node` between them, which join the now-disabled connection's nodes. The connection weights are chosen so as to potentially have
      roughly the same behavior as the original connection, although this will depend on the :term:`activation function`, :term:`bias`, and
      :term:`response` multiplier of the new node. TODO: Particularly if the configuration is changed to only allow one structural mutation, then if there
      are no connections, call :py:meth:`mutate_add_connection` instead of returning.

      1. :term:`input nodes <input node>` cannot be at the output end.
      2. Existing connections cannot be duplicated. TODO: If a selected existing connection is not :term:`enabled`, have some configurable chance that it will become enabled.
      3. Two :term:`output nodes <output node>` cannot be connected together.
      4. If :ref:`feed_forward <feed-forward-config-label>` is set to ``True`` in the configuration file, connections cannot create :py:func:`cycles <graphs.creates_cycle>`.

      :param object config: Genome configuration object

      .. versionchanged:: 0.91-github

      :param object config: Genome configuration object

    .. py:method:: mutate_delete_connection()

      Deletes a randomly-chosen connection. TODO: If the connection is :term:`enabled`, have an option to - possibly with a :term:`weight`-dependent
      chance - turn its enabled attribute to ``False`` instead.

    .. index:: ! compatibility_disjoint_coefficient

    .. index:: genetic distance

    .. py:method:: distance(other, config)

      Required interface method. Returns the :term:`genomic distance` between this genome and the other.
      This distance value is used to compute genome compatibility for :py:mod:`speciation <species>`. Uses (by default) the
      :py:meth:`genes.DefaultNodeGene.distance` and :py:meth:`genes.DefaultConnectionGene.distance` methods for
      :term:`homologous` pairs, and the configured :ref:`compatibility_disjoint_coefficient <compatibility-disjoint-coefficient-label>` for
      disjoint/excess genes. (Note that this is one of the most time-consuming portions of the library; optimization - such as using
      `cython <http://cython.org>`_ - may be needed if using an unusually fast fitness function and/or an unusually large population.)

      Compute connections for a fully-connected feed-forward genome--each input connected to all hidden nodes (and output nodes if ``direct`` is set or
      there are no hidden nodes), each hidden node connected to all output nodes. (Recurrent genomes will also include node self-connections.)

    .. py:method:: complete_extinction()

      Called via :py:class:`ReporterSet` (by :py:meth:`population.Population.run`) if complete extinction (due to stagnation) occurs, prior to

reproduction
-----------------

  .. py:class:: DefaultReproduction(config, reporters, stagnation)

    Handles creation of genomes, either from scratch or by sexual or asexual reproduction from parents. Implements the default NEAT-python reproduction
    scheme: explicit fitness sharing with fixed-time species stagnation. For class requirements, see :ref:`reproduction-interface-label`.

    :param dict config: Configuration object, in this implementation a dictionary.
    :param object reporters: A :py:class:`ReporterSet <reporting.ReporterSet>` object.
    :param object stagnation: A :py:class:`DefaultStagnation <stagnation.DefaultStagnation>` object - the current code partially depends on internals of this class (a TODO is noted to correct this).

    .. py:classmethod:: parse_config(param_dict)

      Required interface method. Provides defaults for :index:`elitism`, :index:`survival_threshold`, and :index:`min_species_size` parameters and updates
      them from the :ref:`configuration file <reproduction-config-label>`. TODO: Use a separate configuration class, for consistency with other types
      (done in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch).

      :param dict param_dict: Dictionary of parameters from configuration file.
      :return: Configuration object; considered opaque by rest of code, so current type returned is not required for interface.
      :rtype: dict

    .. py:classmethod:: write_config(f, param_dict)

      Required interface method. Saves ``elitism`` and ``survival_threshold`` (but not ``min_species_size``) parameters to new config file. (Inconsistency
      re ``min_species_size`` fixed in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch.)

      :param f: File object to write to.
      :type f: `file`
      :param dict param_dict: Dictionary of current parameters in this implementation; more generally, reproduction config object.

    .. index:: genome

    .. py:method:: create_new(genome_type, genome_config, num_genomes)

      Required interface method. Creates ``num_genomes`` new genomes of the given type using the given configuration. Also initializes ancestry
      information (as an empty tuple).

      :param genome_type: Genome class (such as :py:class:`DefaultGenome <genome.DefaultGenome>` or :py:class:`iznn.IZGenome`) of which to create instances.
      :type genome_type: `class`
      :param object genome_config: Opaque genome configuration object.
      :param int num_genomes: How many new genomes to create.
      :return: A dictionary (with the unique genome identifier as the key) of the genomes created.
      :rtype: dict(int, object)

    .. py:staticmethod:: compute_spawn(adjusted_fitness, previous_sizes, pop_size, min_species_size)

      Apportions desired number of members per species according to fitness (adjusted by :py:meth:`reproduce` to a 0-1 scale) from out of the
      desired population size.

      :param adjusted_fitness: Mean fitness for species members, adjusted to 0-1 scale (see below).
      :type adjusted_fitness: list(float)
      :param previous_sizes: Number of members of species in population prior to reproduction.
      :type previous_sizes: list(int)
      :param int pop_size: Desired population size, as input to :py:meth:`reproduce`.

    .. index:: ! elitism
    .. index:: ! survival_threshold
    .. index:: ! species_stagnant()
    .. index:: stagnation
    .. index:: ! info()

    .. py:method:: reproduce(config, species, pop_size, generation)

      Required interface method. Creates the population to be used in the next generation from the given configuration instance, SpeciesSet instance,
      desired :index:`size of the population <pop_size>`, and current generation number.  This method is called after all genomes have been evaluated and
      their ``fitness`` member assigned.  This method should use the stagnation instance given to the initializer to remove species deemed to have stagnated.
      Note: Determines relative fitnesses by transforming into (ideally) a 0-1 scale; however, if the top and bottom fitnesses are not at least 1 apart, the
      range may be less than 0-1, as a check against dividing by a too-small number. TODO: Make minimum difference configurable (defaulting to 1 to
      preserve compatibility).

      :param object config: A :py:class:`Config <config.Config>` instance.
      :param object species: A :py:class:`DefaultSpeciesSet <species.DefaultSpeciesSet>` instance. As well as depending on some of the :py:class:`DefaultStagnation <stagnation.DefaultStagnation>` internals, this method also depends on some of those of the ``DefaultSpeciesSet`` and its referenced species objects.
      :param int pop_size: Population size desired, such as set in the :ref:`configuration file <pop-size-label>`.
      :param int generation: Generation count.
      :return: New population, as a dict of unique genome :term:`ID/key <key>` vs :term:`genome`.
      :rtype: dict(int, object)

  Better documentation for the ``kw`` parameter in the below. Internally, these are using ``**kw`` as a **parameter** for
  keys/items/values/iterkeys/iteritems/itervalues! Is this in case someone puts in a set of key/value pairs instead of a dictionary?
  The `six documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ just states that this parameter is "passed to the underlying method", which is not helpful.

.. py:module:: six_util
   :synopsis: Provides Python 2/3 portability with three dictionary iterators; copied from the `six` module.

six_util
----------
This Python 2/3 portability code was copied from the `six module <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_ to avoid adding it as a dependency.

  .. py:function:: iterkeys(d, **kw)

    This function returns an iterator over the keys of dict d.

    :param dict d: Dictionary to iterate over
    :param kw: The function of this parameter is unclear.

    This function returns an iterator over the (key, value) pairs of dict d.

    :param dict d: Dictionary to iterate over
    :param kw: The function of this parameter is unclear.

  .. py:function:: itervalues(d, **kw)

    This function returns an iterator over the values of dict d.

    :param kw: The function of this parameter is unclear.

.. index:: key

.. py:module:: species
   :synopsis: Divides the population into species based on genomic distances.

species
-----------
Divides the population into species based on :term:`genomic distances <genomic distance>`.

  .. py:class:: Species(key, generation)

    Represents a :term:`species` and contains data about it such as members, fitness, and time stagnating.
    Note: :py:class:`stagnation.DefaultStagnation` manipulates many of these.

    :param int key: :term:`Identifier/key <key>`
    :param int generation: Initial generation of appearance

    .. index:: genomic distance

    .. py:method:: update(representative, members)

      Required interface method. Updates a species instance with the current members and most-representative member (from which
      :term:`genomic distances <genomic distance>` are measured).

      :param object representative: A genome instance.
      :param members: A `dictionary <dict>` of genome :term:`id <key>` vs genome instance.

    .. py:method:: get_fitnesses()

      Required interface method (used by :py:class:`stagnation.DefaultStagnation`, for instance). Retrieves the fitnesses of each member genome.

      :return: List of fitnesses of member genomes.
      :rtype: list(float)

  .. index:: ! genomic distance

  .. py:class:: GenomeDistanceCache(config)

    Caches (indexing by :term:`genome` :term:`key`/id) :term:`genomic distance` information to avoid repeated lookups. (The :py:meth:`distance function
    <genome.DefaultGenome.distance>` is among the most time-consuming parts of the library, although many fitness functions are likely to far outweigh
    this for moderate-size populations.)

    :param object config: A genome configuration object; later used by the genome distance function.

    .. py:method:: __call__(genome0, genome1)

      GenomeDistanceCache is called as a method with a pair of genomes to retrieve the distance.

      :param object genome0: The first genome object.
      :param object genome1: The second genome object.
      :return: The :term:`genomic distance`.
      :rtype: float

  .. py:class:: DefaultSpeciesSet(config, reporters)

    Encapsulates the default speciation scheme by configuring it and performing the speciation function (placing genomes into species by genetic similarity).
    :py:class:`reproduction.DefaultReproduction` currently depends on this having a ``species`` attribute consisting of a dictionary of species keys to species.

    :param object config: A configuration object (currently unused).
    :param object reporters: A :py:class:`ReporterSet <reporting.ReporterSet>` instance giving reporters to be notified about :term:`genomic distance` statistics.

    .. py:classmethod:: parse_config(param_dict)

      Required interface method. Currently, the only configuration parameter is the :ref:`compatibility_threshold <compatibility-threshold-label>`. TODO:
      Use a separate configuration class, for consistency with other types (done in the
      `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch).

      :param param_dict: Dictionary of parameters from configuration file.
      :type param_dict: dict(str, str)
      :return: Configuration object; considered opaque by rest of code, so current type returned is not required for interface.
      :rtype: dict

    .. py:classmethod:: write_config(f, param_dict)

      Required interface method. Writes parameter(s) to new config file.

      :param f: File object to write to.
      :type f: `file`
      :param dict param_dict: Dictionary of current parameters in this implementation; more generally, stagnation config object.

    .. index:: ! genomic distance
    .. index:: compatibility_threshold
    .. index:: info()

    .. py:method:: speciate(config, population, generation)

      Required interface method. Place genomes into species by genetic similarity (:term:`genomic distance`). (The current code has a `docstring` stating
      that there may be a problem if all old species representatives are not dropped for each generation; it is not clear how this is consistent with the code
      in :py:meth:`reproduction.DefaultReproduction.reproduce`, such as for ``elitism``.)

      :param object config: :py:class:`Config <config.Config>` object.
      :param population: Population as per the output of :py:meth:`DefaultReproduction.reproduce <reproduction.DefaultReproduction.reproduce>`.
      :type population: dict(int, object)
      :param int generation: Current generation number.

    .. py:method:: get_species_id(individual_id)

      Required interface method (used by :py:class:`reporting.StdOutReporter`). Retrieves species :term:`id/key <key>` for a given genome id/key.

      :param int individual_id: Genome id/:term:`key`.
      :return: Species id/:term:`key`.
      :rtype: int

    .. py:method:: get_species(individual_id)

      Retrieves species object for a given genome :term:`id/key <key>`. May become a required interface method, and useful for some fitness
      functions already.

      :param int individual_id: Genome id/:term:`key`.
      :return: :py:class:`Species <species.Species>` containing the genome corresponding to the id/key.
      :rtype: object

.. index:: ! species_fitness_func
.. index:: fitness_criterion
.. index:: fitness_threshold

.. note::

  TODO: Currently, depending on the settings for :ref:`species_fitness_func <species-fitness-func-label>` and
  :ref:`fitness_criterion <fitness-criterion-label>`, it is possible for a species with members **above** the :ref:`fitness_threshold <fitness-threshold-label>`
  level of fitness to be considered "stagnant" (including, most problematically, because they are at the limit of fitness improvement).

.. py:module:: stagnation
   :synopsis: Keeps track of whether species are making progress and helps remove ones that are not (for a configurable number of generations).

stagnation
--------------

  .. index:: ! max_stagnation
  .. index:: ! species_elitism

  .. py:class:: DefaultStagnation(config, reporters)

    Keeps track of whether species are making progress and helps remove ones that, for a
    :ref:`configurable number of generations <max-stagnation-label>`, are not.

    :param object config: Configuration object; in this implementation, a `dictionary <dict>`, but should be treated as opaque outside this class.
    :param object reporters: A :py:class:`ReporterSet <reporting.ReporterSet>` instance with reporters that may need activating; not currently used.

    .. py:classmethod:: parse_config(param_dict)

      Required interface method. Provides defaults for :ref:`species_fitness_func <species-fitness-func-label>`,
      :ref:`max_stagnation <max-stagnation-label>`, and :ref:`species_elitism <species-elitism-label>` parameters and updates them
      from the configuration file. TODO: Use a separate configuration class, for consistency with other types
      (done in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch).

      :param param_dict: Dictionary of parameters from configuration file.
      :type param_dict: dict(str, str)
      :return: Configuration object; considered opaque by rest of code, so current type returned is not required for interface.
      :rtype: dict

    .. py:classmethod:: write_config(f, param_dict)

      Required interface method. Saves parameters to new config file. TODO: Has a default of 15 for species_elitism, but will be overridden by the default of
      0 in parse_config (fixed in the `config_work <https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python/tree/config_work>`_ branch).

      :param f: File object to write to.
      :type f: `file`
      :param dict param_dict: Dictionary of current parameters in this implementation; more generally, stagnation config object.

    .. py:method:: update(species_set, generation)

      Required interface method. Updates species fitness history information, checking for ones that have not improved in
      :ref:`max_stagnation <max-stagnation-label>` generations, and - unless it would result in the number of species dropping below the configured
      :ref:`species_elitism <species-elitism-label>` if they were removed, in which case the highest-fitness species are spared - returns a list with
      stagnant species marked for removal. TODO: Currently interacts directly with the internals of the :py:class:`species.Species` object.
      Also, currently **both** checks for num_non_stagnant to stop marking stagnant **and** does not allow the top ``species_elitism`` species to be
      marked stagnant. While the latter could admittedly help with the problem mentioned above, the ordering of species fitness is using the
      fitness gotten from the ``species_fitness_func`` (and thus may miss high-fitness members of overall low-fitness species, depending on the
      function in use).

      :param object species_set: A :py:class:`species.DefaultSpeciesSet` or compatible object.
      :param int generation: The current generation.
      :return: A list of tuples of (species :term:`id/key <key>`, :py:class:`Species <species.Species>` object, is_stagnant).
      :rtype: list(tuple(int, object, bool))

      .. versionchanged:: 0.91-github
        Species sorted to avoid marking best-performing as stagnant even with ``species_elitism``.

.. py:module:: statistics
   :synopsis: Gathers and provides (to callers and/or to a file) information on genome and species fitness, which are the most-fit genomes, and similar.

statistics
-------------

  .. note::
    There are two design decisions to be aware of:
    * The most-fit genomes are based on the highest-fitness member of each generation; other genomes are not saved by this module (if they were, it would far worsen existing potential memory problems - see below), and it is assumed that fitnesses (as given by the :index:`fitness function <single: fitness function>`) are not relative to others in the generation (also assumed by the use of the :ref:`fitness threshold <fitness-threshold-label>` as a signal for exiting). Code violating this assumption (e.g., with competitive coevolution) will need to use different statistical gathering methods.
    * Generally reports or records a per-generation list of values; the numeric position in the list may not correspond to the generation number if there has been a restart, such as via the :py:mod:`checkpoint` module.
    There is also a TODO item: Currently keeps accumulating information in memory, which may be a problem in long runs.


  .. py:class:: StatisticsReporter(BaseReporter)

    Gathers (via the reporting interface) and provides (to callers and/or to a file) the most-fit genomes and information on genome and species fitness
    and species sizes. 

    .. py:method:: post_evaluate(config, population, species, best_genome)

      Called as part of the :py:class:`reporting.BaseReporter` interface after the evaluation at the start of each generation;
      see :py:meth:`BaseReporter.post_evaluate <reporting.BaseReporter.post_evaluate>`.
      Information gathered includes a copy of the best genome in each generation and the fitnesses of each member of each species.

    .. py:method:: get_fitness_stat(f)

      Calls the given function on the genome fitness data from each recorded generation and returns the resulting list.

      :param f: A function that takes a list of scores and returns a summary statistic (or, by returning a list or tuple, multiple statistics) such as ``mean`` or ``stdev``.
      :type f: `function`
      :return: A list of the results from function f for each generation.
      :rtype: list

    .. py:method:: get_fitness_mean()

      Gets the per-generation average fitness. A wrapper for :py:meth:`get_fitness_stat` with the function being ``mean``.

      :return: List of mean genome fitnesses for each generation.
      :rtype: list(float)

    .. py:method:: get_fitness_stdev()

      Gets the per-generation standard deviation of the fitness. A wrapper for :py:meth:`get_fitness_stat` with the function being ``stdev``.

      :return: List of standard deviations of genome fitnesses for each generation.
      :rtype: list(float)

    .. py:method:: best_unique_genomes(n)

      Returns the ``n`` most-fit genomes, with no duplication (from the most-fit genome passing unaltered to the next generation), sorted in decreasing
      fitness order.

      :param int n: Number of most-fit genomes to return.
      :return: List of ``n`` most-fit genomes (as genome objects).
      :rtype: list(object)

    .. py:method:: best_genomes(n)

      Returns the ``n`` most-fit genomes, possibly with duplicates, sorted in decreasing fitness order.

      :param int n: Number of most-fit genomes to return.
      :return: List of ``n`` most-fit genomes (as genome objects).
      :rtype: list(object)

    .. py:method:: best_genome()

      Returns the most-fit genome ever seen. A wrapper around :py:meth:`best_genomes`.

      :return: The most-fit genome.
      :rtype: object

    .. py:method:: get_species_sizes()

      Returns a by-generation list of lists of species sizes. Note that some values may be 0, if a species has either not yet been seen or has been
      removed due to :py:mod:`stagnation`; species without generational overlap may be more similar in :term:`genomic distance` than the configured
      :ref:`compatibility_threshold <compatibility-threshold-label>` would otherwise allow.

      :return: List of lists of species sizes, ordered by species :term:`id/key <key>`.
      :rtype: list(list(int))

    .. py:method:: get_species_fitness(null_value='')

      Returns a by-generation list of lists of species fitnesses; the fitness of a species is determined by the ``mean`` fitness of the genomes in the species,
      as with the reproduction distribution by :py:class:`reproduction.DefaultReproduction`. The ``null_value`` parameter is used for species not present in a
      particular generation (see :py:meth:`above <get_species_sizes>`).

      :param str null_value: What to put in the list if the species is not present in a particular generation.
      :return: List of lists of species fitnesses, ordered by species :term:`id/key <key>`.
      :rtype: list(list(float or str))

    .. py:method:: save_genome_fitness(delimiter=' ', filename='fitness_history.csv', with_cross_validation=False)

      Saves the population's best and mean fitness (using the `csv` package). At some point in the future, cross-validation fitness may be usable (via, for
      instance, the fitness function using alternative test situations/opponents and recording this in a ``cross_fitness`` attribute; this can be used for, e.g.,
      preventing overfitting); currently, ``with_cross_validation`` should always be left at its ``False`` default.

      :param str delimiter: Delimiter between columns in the file; note that the default is not ',' as may be otherwise implied by the ``csv`` file extension (which refers to the package used).
      :param str filename: The filename to open (for writing, not appending) and write to.
      :param bool with_cross_validation: For future use; currently, leave at its ``False`` default.

    .. py:method:: save_species_count(delimiter=' ', filename='speciation.csv')

      Logs speciation throughout evolution, by tracking the number of genomes in each species. Uses :py:meth:`get_species_sizes`; see that method for
